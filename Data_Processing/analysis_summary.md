# CFPB Servicemember Complaint Analysis: Findings and Insights

## Introduction
This report presents an in-depth analysis of consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) over the past five years, with a particular focus on complaints tagged as 'servicemember.' The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and unique challenges faced by servicemembers in the financial marketplace, using advanced data science and natural language processing techniques. The findings are intended for portfolio demonstration and professional presentation.

## Data Preparation and Segmentation
The dataset was rigorously cleaned to ensure accuracy and relevance. Complaints were segmented into two groups: those tagged as 'servicemember' and those from the general population. This separation enabled direct comparison and ensured that insights were specific to the experiences of servicemembers.

## Key Findings

### 1. Complaint Volume and Temporal Trends
- Servicemember complaints exhibit distinct seasonal patterns, with notable increases during the PCS (Permanent Change of Station) season (May to September).
- General complaint volume remains relatively stable, but servicemember complaints show spikes that align with periods of increased relocation and financial activity.

### 2. Product and Issue Frequency
- The most common products associated with servicemember complaints include mortgages, credit cards, and vehicle loans or leases.
- Issue frequency analysis reveals that servicemembers are more likely to report problems related to loan servicing, payment processing, and account transfers compared to the general population.

### 3. Comparative Analysis and Normalization
- When normalized for group size, certain issues and companies are disproportionately represented in servicemember complaints.
- Servicemembers report higher rates of specific issues per 1,000 complaints, highlighting areas where targeted consumer protection may be warranted.

### 4. Company-Level Insights
- A small number of financial institutions account for a significant share of servicemember complaints, particularly in mortgage and vehicle loan products.
- These companies may warrant further scrutiny or engagement to address recurring problems.

### 5. Narrative Analysis and Thematic Clustering
- Topic modeling and n-gram analysis of complaint narratives reveal recurring themes such as payment delays, account access issues, and customer service challenges.
- Semantic clustering using sentence embeddings and t-SNE visualization uncovers distinct groups of complaints, each characterized by unique language and concerns.
- Sample complaints from each cluster provide context and help define the main issues represented.

## Detailed Findings

Over the past five years, servicemember complaints to the CFPB have revealed several distinct patterns and challenges compared to the general population:

- Seasonal Complaint Surges: Servicemember complaint volume shows pronounced increases during the PCS (Permanent Change of Station) season, indicating that financial stress and service disruptions are heightened during periods of relocation. This seasonal effect is not observed in the general population, underscoring the unique impact of military life on financial experiences.

- Product and Issue Concentration: Mortgages, credit cards, and vehicle loans or leases are the most frequently cited products in servicemember complaints. Within these categories, servicemembers disproportionately report issues related to loan servicing, payment processing, and account transfers. These issues often coincide with relocation events, suggesting that servicemembers face additional barriers when managing financial products during moves.

- Disproportionate Representation of Companies: A small number of financial institutions account for a significant share of servicemember complaints, especially in mortgage and vehicle loan products. These companies are repeatedly cited for problems such as delayed payments, misapplied funds, and poor customer service. The concentration of complaints suggests systemic issues that may require targeted regulatory attention.

- Comparative Issue Rates: When normalized for group size, servicemembers report higher rates of certain issues per 1,000 complaints than the general population. For example, complaints about payment processing and account access are notably more frequent among servicemembers, highlighting areas where consumer protection efforts could be strengthened.

- Narrative Themes and Clusters: Topic modeling and semantic clustering of complaint narratives reveal several recurring themes. Servicemember complaints often describe difficulties with timely payment posting, confusion over account status during relocations, and challenges in resolving disputes with financial institutions. Clustering analysis further identifies distinct groups of complaints, each characterized by specific language and concerns, such as relocation-related account problems or persistent customer service failures.

- Implications for Stakeholders: The findings indicate that servicemembers encounter unique financial challenges, particularly during relocation periods. Financial institutions should improve support and communication for military customers, especially during PCS season. Regulators may wish to monitor companies with high rates of servicemember complaints and consider targeted interventions to address recurring issues.
